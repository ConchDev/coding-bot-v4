A discord.py bot for The Coding Academy

Feel free to contribute.

Also we need someone to write a better README

****************
How to self-host
****************
Open up cmd, terminal, or whatever the shell is called on your device. Once in there, run this:

.. code-block:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/The-Coding-Academy/coding-bot-v4.git; cd coding-bot-v4; . ./setup

It will prompt you to input your discord user id and a token for the bot. After this is finished (assuming no errors popped up, if they did they will tell you how to fix it), you can run

.. code-block:: shell

    python bot.py

to start up the bot.
